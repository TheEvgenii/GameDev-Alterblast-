A sandwich-based, 2D, top-down, rogue-like shooter. The player controls a character via mouse and keyboard as they traverse rooms of enemies. Enemies drop distinct power-ups to help aid in the player’s abilities. Battling tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, and other sandwich fixings as the hoagie main character gathers ingredients to become the best sandwich they can be. The player will ultimately face-off against the main boss, a deadly pig, to claim their main ingredient. Maybe, the hoagie will even get to face off against the aristocracy who dooms them to search out for the perfect sandwich ingredients. Or, maybe, you’ll just end up as lunch for the rich rulers of bread-land.
